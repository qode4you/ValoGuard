# FAQ

  

## Can I get banned for using ValoGuard?

Activating macros that trigger actions in the game is bannable, but ValoGuard does not work in a specific pattern and has a realistic reaction time, so Vanguard cannot detect it and the security of your account is guaranteed.

**IMPORTANT:**

Remember, however, that each player is responsible for the actions on his account. If you choose to use ValoGuard, it is your responsibility if you get banned for using it. I do not take any responsibility for any damage caused.

  

## How do I stop ValoGuard?

ValoGuard stops automatically after 80 minutes, if you want to stop it earlier you have to close the ValoGuard window via the X.
